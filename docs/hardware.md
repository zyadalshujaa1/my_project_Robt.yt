## ‚öôÔ∏è Summary
The hardware setup integrates:  
- **Raspberry Pi** (main controller with ROS)  
- **ESP32** (motor controller)  
- **Servo Motors** (actuation)  
- **Kinect Sensor** (vision & motion tracking)  
- **Speakers & Microphone** (voice I/O)  
- **3D Printed Body**  

Together, these components enable the robot to perform **vision, speech, motion, and interaction tasks** seamlessly.
